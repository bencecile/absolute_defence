# Ideas
## Names
- Absolute Defence / 絶対防御

## Mechanics
- A Game mostly about taking damage and raising your defence
- Inspired by 盾の勇者 and 防振り
- A shield is your main (or only) equipment
- Character Stats
    - Health
    - Defense
    - ?Maybe elemental resistances
- Enemy Stats
    - Attack
    - Attack Chances?
        - They would flee after these chances are done
- Some way to kill enemies later would feel cool
    - ?Maybe thorns
    - ?Could use other enemies (throwing or mind control or seduce, etc)
    - ?Long cooldown skill
- If throwing enemies is a mechanic, then enemies should have a weight and the player should have a lift strength stat
- Some enemies may be ranged so you can't grab them
- Health potions and maybe other consumables
- Crafting consumables
- Crafting or improving equipment
- The player will to turn to defend against any enemy attacking them (by default)
- The player will take more damage from behind (behind the perpendicular of the player's direction)

## Pitch #1
- A top-down view on your head
- You're trying to move forward as far as possible
- Enemies are swarming you trying to take you down
- Would have very simple graphics
    - Probably just a dot for yourself
    - Maybe other shapes or contours for the enemies

## Pitch #2
- A tick based game where things only happen every tick

## Pitch #3
- Turn based game
    - I would like this to be at least somewhat automated

## Implementation
- Made with Rust to run in a Web browser using WebAssembly
- Should be both in Japanese and English
- See if you can make it decent on mobile
